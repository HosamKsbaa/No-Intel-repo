Got it—here’s a fast, evidence-based deep dive on **Talent 360 ME** with clients (as publicly traceable), who they work with, and key competitors. I searched the open web (Google, Google News), hiring boards, and social profiles.

# Snapshot

# What they do (from their pages & hiring footprint)

* **Talent acquisition / RPO** across tech, creative, ops; many roles posted “on behalf of clients.” ([talent360.freshteam.com][5])
* **Training/OD / team-building, employer branding** (noted in funding PR). ([Bizpreneur Me][6])

# Who they’re working with (public traces)

> These are **inferred clients** because Talent 360 posts vacancies “for one of our clients” or names the client in job ads. I only list those **explicitly named** in their job board to avoid speculation.

* **SRV Spaces** (B2B facility supplies) — multiple roles (Sales, Warehouse Ops, etc.). ([talent360.freshteam.com][7])
* **Amenli** (insurtech) — Backend Developer hiring. ([talent360.freshteam.com][5])

> Their Instagram and website also claim **“230+ companies”** served across Egypt & KSA, but do not list all logos publicly (site intermittently returns 502). ([Instagram][8])

# Client segments (observed)

* **Tech/software** (MicroBIM, Wind Integrated Solutions, Amenli, product/engineering roles). ([talent360.freshteam.com][5])

**Regional & enterprise-grade recruiters/outsourcers (operate in KSA/UAE & MENA):**

* **Adecco Middle East, Michael Page ME, Robert Walters ME, Cooper Fitch, TASC Outsourcing, AMS, Korn Ferry** (broader scope; compete on TA/RPO rather than SME HR-ops). *(Representative industry set; see sector directories/rankings.)* ([Clutch][15])

# Signals from news & public posts (2025)

* **KSA expansion priority** with local investor/advisor (**C.STAR / Hatem AlGhamdi**); messaging ties to **Vision 2030**, AI HR tooling, and rebrand. (Jan 19–24, 2025). ([Bizpreneur Me][6])

## Notes on methodology & caveats

* **Client list:** Talent 360 does not publish a comprehensive client roster; the list above is compiled **only** from posts that explicitly name a client in **their own** job board ads, which is a reliable proxy for active or recent engagements. ([talent360.freshteam.com][5])
* **LinkedIn restrictions:** Direct LinkedIn pages are partially blocked for scraping; I leaned on news sites, career boards, and alternative sources that reference the same facts. ([AIM Group][19])
* **Website intermittency:** Their site sometimes returns 502—so some sections couldn’t be mirrored; where available, I cited cached/working pages.

## Want me to go further?

I can:

1. cross-match each named client above with **press/news** or **LinkedIn company announcements** for confirmation;
2. build a **side-by-side competitor grid** (services, pricing model/EOR, sectors, KSA footprint, typical tickets);
3. scrape more job boards for **additional client mentions** (Bayt, WUZZUF, Qureos) and assemble a CSV.
