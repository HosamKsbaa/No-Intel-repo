Got it Hosam — let me re-summarize everything in **English** and focus fully on **clients** (who Elite Talent works for).

# What I looked for (client-focused re-search)

* Official website (About, Services, News, Jobs, Values).
* Job boards (Workable, Jobgether, JobZone, community job groups on Facebook/Telegram).
* Social media (LinkedIn, Instagram).
* Google News / articles.
* Tech/competitor databases.

# Findings (as of 28 Sep 2025)

## 1) Direct client list

* **No official client names are published** on their website, News, Articles, or Values pages.
* **No press releases or news mentions** connecting Elite Talent to specific companies.

## 2) Indirect client signals (through jobs)

* Their job ads are often posted “on behalf of a client” without naming the company.
* Roles seen across Workable/aggregators:

  * **Customer service / Call center**
  * **Sales (B2B, sales managers)**
  * **Finance & Accounting (senior accountant, finance manager)**
  * **Digital / Tech (Digital Transformation Manager, Full-Stack Developer, Product roles, UI/UX)**
  * **Real estate projects (Project Director, Real Estate roles)**
  * **Energy/operations** — ads found on Telegram job channels for “Fuel System Technician” and “Firefighter” **inside Baghdad Green Zone**, hinting that some clients are in **critical facilities (government, energy, or protected sites)**.

## 3) Social media

* **Instagram & LinkedIn** are active but promotional only — no client logos, no “thank you to our partners” posts.
* Founder **Othman Waleed**’s LinkedIn profile does not mention specific client companies.

## 4) News & articles

* No external news coverage naming their clients.
* Their own “News/Articles” pages are mostly empty.

# Bottom line

* **Elite Talent does not disclose client names publicly.**
* From job roles and descriptions, their clients are **very likely in these sectors**:

  * Customer service/call centers
  * Banking/finance
  * Digital transformation/technology
  * Real estate projects
  * Energy/fuel/critical infrastructure (Green Zone hints)
* But **no named company** is confirmed in open sources.

# How to uncover actual client names (playbook)

1. **LinkedIn deep dive** → scan Elite Talent employee posts (they sometimes tag or thank clients).
2. **Job ad text mining** → some ads might accidentally reveal client names (“Our client, X Bank, seeks…”).
3. **Community job groups** → sometimes admins post the client name when resharing Elite Talent jobs.
4. **Cross-referencing roles** → if a niche role (e.g., “Digital Transformation Manager Baghdad”) appears both on Elite Talent and on another company’s website, that company is likely the client.
5. **Licensing & government tender databases** → competitors (e.g., Warani, SES) openly publish license numbers; Elite Talent doesn’t. Licensing disclosures may link them to public contracts.

# Key insight

At this stage, Elite Talent’s **client base is opaque** — deliberately hidden behind “on behalf of client” postings. What can be said:

* They are **serving MENA clients in multiple sectors**, with a heavy emphasis on **Iraq (Baghdad, Green Zone, Basra)**.
* They **likely serve government-linked or energy sector clients**, but this is inferred from job descriptions, **not explicitly named**.

👉 Do you want me to build you a **tracking table** (all Elite Talent job postings we can find + inferred sector + potential matching company)? That way, you’ll have a structured view of where their business likely is.
